                  Users of our Services who have JavaScript enabled are tracked
                  using analytics technologies, including Google Analytics and
                  Mixpanel. Unless the Analytics feature is blocked, it collects
                  the following types of information from the user: type of user
                  agent (web browser) used, software manufacture and version
                  number; type of operating system; network location and IP
                  address; country, city, state, region, county, or any other
                  geographic data; hostname; bandwidth (internet connection
                  speed); time of visit; pages visited; time spent on each page
                  of the website; referring site statistics; the website (URL)
                  the user came through in order to arrive at our website;
                  search engine query used (example: typing in a phrase into a
                  search engine, and clicking on a link from that search
                  engine). The data collected by the analytics technology is
                  primarily used to optimize the Service experience for our
                  users. We also use this data for our own business purposes,
                  for example, to analyze how many users we have, where visitors
                  come from, and understand how they interact with us.

                We safeguard the security of the information you provide to us
                with physical, electronic, and administrative procedures. For
                certain features of our Services we use industry-standard
                SSL-encryption to enhance the security of data transmissions.
                Your account information is password-protected for your privacy
                and security. While we strive to protect your information, we
                cannot guarantee the security of the Internet, and cannot ensure
                the security of the information that is transmitted through the
                Internet.

                Please recognize that protecting your Personal Information is
                also your responsibility. We urge you to take every precaution
                to protect your information when you are on the Internet, or
                when you communicate with us and with others through the
                Internet. Change your passwords often, use a combination of
                letters and numbers, and make sure you use a secure browser. If
                you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no
                longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of
                your account might have been compromised), or if you suspect
                someone else is using your account, please let us know
                immediately by contacting us as indicated in the “Contact Us”
                section. If your credit information, username, or password is
                lost, stolen, or used without permission, please promptly notify
                us and we will assist you in updating your account details. Some
                portions of the Services (for example our presence on social
                media) allow users to submit comments, reviews, ratings, and
                other information that may be displayed on the Services and
                viewed by others. We recommend that you do not post on or
                through the Services any information that you do not want to
                make available to other users or the public generally. You
                assume all responsibility for any loss of privacy or other harm
                resulting from information you post publicly.

                We are committed to protecting the privacy of children in
                connection with the use of our Services. This Section explains
                our online information collection, disclosure, and parental
                consent practices with respect to information collection from
                children under the age of 13 (“child” or “children”) in
                accordance with the U.S. Children’s Online Privacy Protection
                Act (“COPPA”). For more information about COPPA and general tips

                Our Services include online services that may be used to
                facilitate health care for a child. A parent or guardian can
                create a Vien Health account on behalf of a dependent child and
                attest that they have legal authority to do so. Children under
                the age of 18 are not eligible to register directly for an
                account. If your child directly uses their Vien Health account,
                either with or without your permission, we may collect
                information directly from the child. If you prefer for your
                child to not directly interact with Vien Health online, please
                do not provide account credentials to your child. Please note
                certain state patient privacy laws may permit a child to
                directly obtain certain types of health care services
                independent of their parent or guardian.

                Registration: Children cannot directly register for our
                Services. During the user registration process, the parent or
                guardian can create a children’s account by providing certain
                information about the child, including name, birth date,
                address, email, and password.

                Consent: During account registration for a child, parents or
                guardians are asked to review and consent to our COPPA Parental
                Consent form. If a parent or guardian chooses not to consent to
                the collection and use of their child’s information, they may
                not create an online account for the child. At any time, a
                parent and guardian may revoke their consent for us to further
                collect personal information from their child online by
                contacting privacy@vienhealth.com. Once consent is revoked, a
                child may not use any Services online.
