                changes. However, you are entitled to the full scope of your

              <p>
                The Program is a direct health care service; it is not health
                insurance. Vien Health does not participate with or bill
                commercial health insurance plans or federal health care
                programs such as Medicare or Medicaid. Vien Health providers may
                recommend you receive services not offered by Vien Health (e.g.,
                specialty services, diagnostic tests), but in no event will Vien
                Health be responsible for any resulting medical bills.
              </p>
              <p>
                You are solely responsible for payment of all fees for Vien
                Health’s services. If you do have health insurance, your
                insurance policy is a contract between you and your insurance
                company. It is your responsibility to know your benefits, and
                how they will apply to your benefit payments. Vien Health takes
                no responsibility to understand or be bound by the terms and
                conditions of such insurance. There is no guarantee your
                insurance company will make any payment on the cost of the
                services you have purchased.

              </div>
              <p>
                To participate in the Program, your Membership Fee payments will
                be charged to your credit card on a recurring basis. You hereby
                agree to allow Vien Health’s to securely store your credit /
                debit card information (the “Payment Method”). You authorize the
                Payment Method to be used automatically for your payment
                responsibilities to Vien Health. If a credit card account is
                being used for a transaction, Vien Health may obtain preapproval
                for an amount up to the amount of the payment. If you want to
                designate a different payment method or if there is a change in
                your Payment Method information, you can change the information
                with Vien Health. This may temporarily delay your ability to
                make online payments while Vien Health verifies the new payment
                information. You represent and warrant that: (1) any credit /
                debit card information you supply is true, correct and complete,
                (2) charges you incur will be honored by your credit/debit card
                company, (3) you will pay the charges incurred in the amounts
                posted, including any applicable taxes, and (4) you are the
                person in whose name the credit / debit card was issued and are
                authorized to make a purchase or other transaction with the
                relevant credit / debit card and information. You agree and
                authorize the Payment Method to be billed automatically in
                accordance with the Membership Fee Payment Schedule in an amount
                equal to the Membership Fee in effect for your Membership Term.
